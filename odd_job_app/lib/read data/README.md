# Directed towards Willy and Mimi !!!

**Note for Willy:** 

- In this folder, you will write all the calls to fetch the job fields from the database. I already wrote the first class to fetch the job title fields. Just make more classes to collect all the fields that we save to the database.

**Note for Mimi:** 

- Please take a look at the ```home_page.dart``` to see how I fetch the job title fields from the read data folder so you can easily encorperate them into the front end design for the home page.
